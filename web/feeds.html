<h1>Kanji of the Day</h1>

<p>Here are some RSS feeds that show a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">kanji</a>, its reading and definition, and example words.  The RSS feeds are updated once a day.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> is a kind of news feed.  You'll want a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator">news reader</a> to make proper use of these.</p>
